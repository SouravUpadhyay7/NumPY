# NumPy Practice Repository  

This repository contains all my practice questions from the NumPy lectures by **Ashish Jhangra Sir** on **GeeksforGeeks**.  

## About  
I am learning **NumPy**, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. This repo serves as my personal collection of solved problems, concepts, and hands-on exercises from the lectures.  

## How to Use  
Feel free to explore the code and practice the problems alongside the lectures. If you find any errors or have suggestions, let me know! ðŸš€  

Happy Coding! âœ¨
